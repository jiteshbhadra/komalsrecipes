Need an easy way to automatically insert post ads?

In-post ads get the best click through rate. If you want to increase your CTR and Google AdSense revenue, then you need to insert post ads within your content.

Insert Post Ads allows you to automatically insert post ads after a specified number of paragraphs. This saves you the hassle of manually inserting post ads for every post.

This ads plugin is based on our article about <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-insert-ads-within-your-post-content-in-wordpress/" title="How to Insert Ads within your Post Content in WordPress" rel="friend">how to insert ads within your post content in WordPress</a>.

We created this plugin to make it as easy as possible to insert ads in posts.

* Insert post ads using any third party advertising code, or custom code
* Select whether to insert post ads on posts, pages, or custom post types.
